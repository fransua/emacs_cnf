               Some Notes on PARIEMACS
               =======================

This package contains two emacs modes written to use jointly emacs and
pari/gp: gp-script-mode to edit scripts for gp, and gp-mode to run gp
a a sub process of (gnu-)emacs. This combination has (rather poorly)
been called pari-mode; the name pariemacs is now preferred and will
maybe soon be called pari-emacs :-).

This is to be used with PARI/GP version 2.4.1 at least and emacs
version at least 21. It works with the emacs 22 series also, but see
the end of this file if you use both. This version has not been tested
with XEmacs and mishaps are likely to occur, but you are welcome to
mention them.

INSTALLATION.
=============

PARIEMACS consists of 12 files: README (this file, for information
only), CHANGES, pari.el, pari-conf.el that contains system dependent
variables and seven additional files that can be looked upon as
modules. In particular, they may be missing without altering the core
behaviour.

You can use the Makefile attached to install this files.  This means
you only have to run:
     tar zxvf pariemacs-3.03.tar.gz
     cd pariemacs-3.03/
     make
You may need to edit the file Makefile in the pariemacs-3.02/
directory to suit your installation: in Debian

   PARI_CFG=/usr/lib/pari/pari.cfg

for instance. You may also want to change the installation directory:

   INSTALL=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/pari

This will first write the file pari-conf.el from pari-conf.el.in.
This file contains the names and paths to the executables and you may
need to edit it if the automatic detection fails.  Then files are
byte-compiled and installed.  If the installation directory is not in
your EMACSLOADPATH, read a full path and not only "pari" in the line
below. Since these files are interconnected, some compilation
warnings regarding unknown variables may occur and are to be
discarded.

You may continue with "make clean" which will remove the compiled
files (.elc) from where you unpacked the pariemacs package.

To use PARIEMACS, users should add the following line to their .emacs:

(autoload 'gp-mode "pari" nil t)
(autoload 'gp-script-mode "pari" nil t)
(autoload 'gp "pari" nil t)
(autoload 'gpman "pari" nil t)

Some specific highlighting is then enabled when editing *.gp files
(termed gp-scripts below), a menu item GP-script will be available
when editing such scripts and two main new commands are made available:

M-x gp      starts up the pari-gp process in a new buffer,  *PARI*
            A menu item GP is available with some specific comamnds.
M-x gpman   starts up a dvi previewer with the PARI-GP manual. 

===========================================================================

GP-MODE/GP-SCRIPT-MODE:
=======================

The file pari.el introduces two modes. The first one, called gp-mode,
is patterned for executing commands under gp. You can then use gp as
if you had typed "gp" on your terminal, except that some more features
are available, in particular a full page editor (namely emacs !). The
second mode is gp-script-mode which helps the user to write gp-scripts
(programs). Some further commands are available and described
below. Most of these commands are available through the menu-bar items
GP-script and GP. Starting a gp process under emacs will automatically
trigger gp-mode. To use gp-script-mode, you have two possibilities:
either to add the following lines to your .emacs:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.gp$" . gp-script-mode)
                              auto-mode-alist))

so that any file with the suffix ".gp" will be understood as a
gp-script and its edition will trigger gp-script-mode, either to
simply make the first line of your program be

\\  -*-gp-script-*-

(In fact you can put anything on this first line, provided you include
the string "-*-gp-script-*-"). A second menu-bar item is installed,
namely GP-functions (built via imenu.el) which contains the list of
all function definitions contained in your file. Clicking on one of
them will automatically send the cursor at the beginning of the
corresponding definition, which is rather handy while writing large
programs.

Most key bindings are recalled on the menu-bar, so we only describe
some of them. Unusual keys common to both modes:

KEY      LISP-NAME             DESCRIPTION
===      =========             ===========
M-i      gp-complete           Complete the partly typed gp input line.

These functions and more can be accessed through the menu-bar or through
M-x lisp-name.

Commands common to gp-mode and to gp-script-mode may behave
differently whether a gp process is running or not. More information
is available if a gp process is running.

The buffer *PARI* is set in gp-mode and the following extra commands are
available:

KEY      LISP-NAME             DESCRIPTION
===      =========             ===========
RET      gp-send-input         Copy current expression to the end,
                               and send to gp.
M-c      gp-copy-input         Copy current expression to the end.
M-RET    gp-C-j                Split the line.
C-j      gp-C-j                Split the line.
C-i/TAB  gp-complete           Same as M-i which can also be used.
M-\ \    gp-break-long-line    Break a long line at current width, inserting \.

The next four keys are a bit special:
C-n     gp-next-input     / next-line
C-p     gp-previous-input / previous-line
M-n     next-line         / gp-next-input
C-p     previous-line     / gp-previous-input

Initially the usual C-n/C-p look for the next/previous input and
M-n/M-p for the next/previous line.  Menu-bar item [GP/Switch] is a
switch between these two sets, and will exchange them.

up      previous-line  / gp-previous-history
C-up    gp-previous-history  / previous line
down    next-line  / gp-next-history
C-down  gp-next-history  / next-line

The first bindings are the one chosen if you set gp-arrow-behaviour to
"Usual" (thats's the default). The second bindings are the one
triggered by the value "Bash-Style" given to this variable. See
CUSTOMIZATION section below for how to set this variable.

Furthermore, concerning history, you may also use

M-up    gp-previous-history-search
M-down  gp-next-history-search

Both recall history but select commands starting with what is between
end of prompt and (point), and all history commands work only after
last prompt. Furthermore, we do not record entries that are less than
two charecters wide nor identical consecutive entries.

Within a gp-script set in gp-script-mode, the following extra commands
are available:

KEY      LISP-NAME             DESCRIPTION
===      =========             ===========
M-x gp   gp                    Start a gp session with default parameters.
C-u M-o                        Quit editing a completion file.
C-c C-e  sli-maid              Closes constructs for you.
                               In fact it'll close parenthesis ...
The two keys RET and M-RET are special. Together they command the introduction
of a newline, with some indentation. The actions are as follows:
         newline               Insert a newline, but do *not* redo
                               the indentation.
         sli-electric-terminate-line
                               Indent line properly, insert a newline
                               and indent next line.
Which key does what is controlled by the variable gp-auto-indent.
If t, RET is sli-electric-terminate-line otherwise it is M-RET.

Note that most of these commands use the emacs meta key (M-).
This one may be marked `left' `right' `extended character'  `<>'
or various other markings. If your keyboard has not got a meta key. You
can use the escape key as a prefix.

Thus M-\ corresponds to pressing meta and \ together, or pressing 
ESC followed by \ .
===========================================================================

RET
===
If point is after the last gp prompt,  pressing RET sends current gp
expression to the gp process. If point is at some previous expression, this
expression (which may be several lines long) is copied to the end of the
buffer and then executed. If the expression is incomplete, it is *not* sent
to gp, and a `virtual' newline is inserted like via C-j. Since emacs does
not produce a syntactical analysis of your input, the definition of a
complete expression is fairly simple-minded : parenthesis `(' `{' and `['
should be properly closed, the last character should not be "\" and not be
within a string. If none of these criteria applies, the input is declared
complete, whether you were in the middle of a comment or not...

M-RET / C-j
===========
Introduce a `virtual' newline, so that you can have a input of gp taking
several lines. The same behaviour is obtained if you type \ followed by RET.
While copying an expression, virtual newlines are automatically converted
to "\" followed by a newline.

M-c
===
M-c, acts like RET, except that the expression is not sent to the gp
process. It is just copied to the end, so that it may be edited, and then
RET pressed, to send the new expression to gp.

M-i
===
M-i tries to complete the partly typed gp commands. In the *PARI*
buffer, you can also use TAB or C-i as usual. If GP was compiled with the
readline library, it knows about all symbols meaningful to GP, plus some
extra keywords (bnf, nf, ell, etc.)

Otherwise, it originally `knows' about all the standart commands of GP.
User-defined commands will be known to the completion system if they are
given as arguments to M-?. Look also at the description of the M-/ key.

===========================================================================

FONTIFYING:
===========

If you're using X Windows on a color monitor, Emacs will use different
colors to display various parts when in gp-mode (when GP is running)
or in gp-script-mode (while editing a file with suffix .gp or after typing
M-x gp-script-mode). The colors chosen for fontification can be modified
and customised through the menu-bar; They are then stored in your .emacs
file.

Troubles may occur with "}". A "}" followed by a newline indicates the
end of a function definition (starting with a "}"). Spaces ot tab-characters
are *not* allowed there. So if you use "}" in a string, simply don't
have it followed by a newline --- and pari.el won't get confused.

NOTE: in order to set the colours, emacs has to be in charge from the
moment you send a command until GP outputs an answer. When a command which
takes a long time for GP to process, you can hit C-g at any time, which will
not affect GP (like C-c would), but will let you back in control of emacs.
The output of this specific command will then not be highlighted: you can
refontify the buffer by C-l.

You should customize the setting through the menu-bar, the proper lines
will then be added to your .emacs file. Note that there is two levels of
customization: font-lock-mode defines some default values and it is good
policy than to use these defaults. You may however decide otherwise and set
local (differing) value. For instance, default value to color function
names is font-lock-function-name-face while local one is gp-function-proto.
If you do not change the latter, it will equal the former. If you want to
go back to default setting, erase the corresponding line in your .emacs
file.
  Emacs about the following symbolic fontification groups:

    in gp-mode (corresponding somehow to what default(colors,...) would do):  
      gp-control-statement  gp-default-keywords  gp-default-set
      gp-comment            gp-string            gp-function-proto
      gp-function-args         gp-error   gp-history  gp-prompt 
      gp-time-word gp-output  gp-input    gp-timer  gp-help 

    in gp-script-mode:
      gp-control-statement  gp-default-keywords  gp-default-set
      gp-comment            gp-string            gp-function-proto
      gp-function-args         gp-input-cmd  gp-global-var

    An actual face (font shape + color) is associated to all patterns belonging
    to a group. See the variable x-colors of for valid color names.

===========================================================================

COMPLETION:
===========

See also the description of the TAB key above.

Initially, emacs "knows" all the symbols that are listed by the
command gphelp -k "", i.e. essentially all the standard
function/variable names.  If gp has been built with readline, it knows
also some extra symbols.  In this case and while editing gp-scripts,
emacs will try to start a gp-session in the background and ask
readline. Note that it is compulsory for gphelp to be available and
that the behaviour will be better if a gp-process can be
started. Furthermore, M-/ from the standard dabbrev.el will complete
word according to words found around, or in nearby buffers. You will
thus avoid typing a-very-long-name-for-your-function.

===========================================================================

HELP:
=====

Help is available through two distinct forms, in text or in TeX, and
essentially through the menu-bar. In TeX form you can see a TeX version
of the manual (via xdvi or something similar), while in text form, a
browser is available which starts on an independant frame. In TeX, you
can see the tutorial file, and in text, you have access to a survey of
the chapter headings of the manual.

Furthermore, you can ask for specific help on a given function in both
forms, and in text, you can ask for the list of all commands that contain
a given string in their description. All these menu-bar items have fairly
self-descriptive name, except maybe the last one which is called via
[GP or GP-script/Info.../on Subject...].

Finally this file is obtainable through the menu-bar. The variable
gp-pariemacs should contain the proper file, but since it is intended
for people who have not read these lines, it is looked for in "probable"
directories. 
===========================================================================

INDENTATION:
============

From version 2.51 onwards, indentation is automatically carried out.
You need to have the file sli-tools.el (version 0.9 most probably)
which provides the feature 'sli-tools. Here is an example of the style
supported:

check(H,q)=
{
  local(n,x,where,x1,x2,p1,p2,sz,ordre2,
        lastterm,newterm,res);
  ordre2=2;lastterm=mod(2,q);
  newterm=lastterm^2;
 
  while(lastterm<>newterm,
        ordre2=ordre2+1;lastterm=newterm;newterm=2*newterm);
  sz=length(H);
  res=vector(ordre2^2*sz^2);
   where=1;
  for(x1=0,ordre2-1,
    for(x2=0,ordre2-1,
       for(p1=1,sz,
          for(p2=1,sz,
             res[where]=lift(mod())))))
}

or also:

{Conditions(p)=
   /* Ici on met les conditions que p doit verifier*/
   if(p%3 == 1, return(1) , return(0));
}

Tuning it finely requires reading the file sli-tools.el, but here is a short
introduction of what happens. The variable gp-structures is initially
'((["for(" head 3] [")" end])
   (["return(" head 3] [")" end])
   (["(" head 1] [")" end])
   (["[" head 1] ["]" end])
   (["{" head gp-indent-level] ["}" end])
   (["=" math-relation 1]) ;that's the last item of any relation, like in '=='
   (["<" math-relation 1])
   ([">" math-relation 1])
   )
meaning that "for(" is to be closed by ")" and so on. Furthermore, between
these two strings the indentation with respect of the beginning of the "for("
is 3 spaces. The indentation after "{" is decided by gp-indent-level.
This string is special because it appears in gp-fixed-keys-alist: when
it occurs as the first word of a line, it will be placed at a fixed place
from the left margin, originally separated by 0 spaces from it.

If you want a style like
{
check(H,q)=
  local(n,x,where,x1,x2,p1,p2,sz,ordre2,
        lastterm,newterm,res);
  ordre2=2;lastterm=mod(2,q);
  newterm=lastterm^2;
 
  while(lastterm<>newterm,
        ordre2=ordre2+1;lastterm=newterm;newterm=2*newterm);
  sz=length(H);
  res=vector(ordre2^2*sz^2);
   where=1;
  for(x1=0,ordre2-1,
    for(x2=0,ordre2-1,
       for(p1=1,sz,
          for(p2=1,sz,
             res[where]=lift(mod())))))
}

things are a bit more difficult but can be got around by always using the "local"
keyword. Set gp-structures to
'((["for(" head 3] [")" end])
   (["return(" head 3] [")" end])
   (["(" head 1] [")" end])
   (["[" head 1] ["]" end])
   (["{" head 0] ["local" strong 0] ["}" end])
   (["=" math-relation 1])
   (["<" math-relation 1])
   ([">" math-relation 1])
   )
and gp-fixed-keys-alist to
'(("local" . gp-indent-level) ("}" . 0))

===========================================================================

LANGUAGE:
=========

You can somehow choose your language. The choice is restricted between french
and english up to now, till someone is ready to translate the corresponding
messages. However, most of emacs messages will come through in english...
And this file is in (an approximation of) english... Furthermore, french
is not accented to avoid compatibility problems. Another option would be
to write a separate file for each language, we'll see later.

The choice is done through the menu-bar entry [GP/Customize...]. Then select
gp-language, choose your language and restart you session of emacs since the 
menu-bar will have changed. If you feel brave and want to add a
language, write to ramare AT math.univ-lille1.fr (you can by the way rewrite
the "english" part...).

===========================================================================

CUSTOMIZATION:
==============

Environment variables should be set via the menu-bar, via the two menu-bar
items [GP or GP-script/Customize...] and [GP or GP-script/Colors/Customize...].
You also can use the classical way through a hook as explained in the
note number 3 below. 

Within  the customization-window, you should save these values for them
to become valid. Note that the variables having something to do with the
menu-bar or font-lock-faces will affect only next session since they are
computed at the beginning of each session. The same applies to 'gp-no-fontify
since it is only used at the beginning of the session to set 'gp-can-fontify
which is in fact the relevant variable.

===========================================================================

LISP EXPRESSIONS IN GP-SCRIPTS:
===============================

A new functionnality of version 2.21 is the possibility to introduce
emacs-lisp-commands inside a gp-script. Emacs lisp commands can be
inserted anywhere and will be executed prior to sending the file to
gp. The file should be edited for emacs to take care of these
commands. They are to be surrounded by "/*@" and "*/", like in

/*@
(setq gp-prompt-pattern (gp-make-gp-prompt-pattern "^NewOne: "))
*/

An additional cookie is the string "\\@" which, when located in a
program at the beginning of a line and followed by a newline is
understood as emacs-should-not-wait-for-output-of-the-program, which
is convenient while working with lengthy programs that give partial
answers.  In fact, the effect of "\\@" can be obtained by writing

/*@ (setq gp-should-wait-for-outputp nil) */

This variable is automatically reset to t after the output.
Concerning this functionnality, a hook gp-input-filter-hook is run
whenever an input is sent to gp. It can be set in the .emacs and can
be modified in the file itself. For instance, if the file
"with-syntax.el" contains the function 'translate, we can use

/*@
(load-file "with-syntax.el")
(setq gp-input-filter-hook (list 'translate))
*/

By "translation" we mean applying some transformations to a gp-script
before sending it to gp. There is a general file "pari-translator.el"
which contains functions handy for writing such a translator. An
exemple is provided by the file "with-syntax.el" which enables one to
use the syntax "with(foo,to_do)" in a gp-program. Details can be found
in this file. It is possible to write a file translating
gp-syntax-old-version into gp-syntax-new-version. More complicated is
to write a file translating simple MuPAD-syntax into gp-syntax.

===========================================================================

HANDLING OF MISTAKES:
=====================

If you edit a program, execute it (or part of it) via the menu-bar,
and an error is found, then emacs will try to locate the typo in your
script. Note that this script should be in a visible
window. Sometimes, the place shown will not be the proper one and you
can ask for the next matching occurence by selecting the menu-item
"Skip-to-error". Incidentally, this function will also start the
search even if the buffer is not visible, in which case the search
will start from the begining of the buffer and not from
point-location.

In the *PARI* buffer, mistake will be displayed on a separate window,
so as not to crowd your session. However you can disable this
behaviour by setting the variable 'gp-no-separate-window-for-mistakes
to t.  Exception to this is a \r command whose output will never go to
a separate window.

Alternatively, you can delete last output through the key C-kp-subtract
(Control and the - from the numerical keypad), and all of last in- and
out-put via M-kp-subtract.

===========================================================================

LOCKED MODE:
============

While working with gp, it is often convenient to pick up a previous
input and modify it. The trouble with this method is that the first
input is destroyed and your file becomes less readable. You can use
M-c to copy the input around cursor to the end and there modify it,
but you may be lazier than that... With the locked mode, any tentative
modification of an earlier input will result in the copying of this
input to the end of your file and the modification is carried out
there. That's the meaning of the variable 'gp-locked-mode which is t
(true) by default. You can set it to nil (false) if this behaviour is
not what you expect.  You can enter this semi-mode (it is not really
an emacs mode neither major nor minor) via the menu-bar item
[GP or GP-script/Customize/Trust Mode], or through usual customization 
(hook or menu-bar).

===========================================================================

TRUST MODE:
============

Only in gp-mode. If you use the instruction "input", emacs will get fully
blocked if the prompt you use is not the same as appears usually on your
screen. This is because emacs waits for the prompt to appear to declare
gp has stopped working. This behaviour can be prevented, and that's what
the "trust-mode" is all about. If you set the variable gp-trust-mode to
t then emacs will not wait for gp to send the prompt. However, in this mode
you have to be careful not to confuse emacs, since the prompt is its usual
reference point. You can enter this semi-mode (it is not really an emacs
mode neither major nor minor) via the menu-bar item 
[GP or GP-script/Customize/Trust Mode],
or via usual customization (hook or menu-bar). You can also set it by sending
"/* Trust = On */" to gp, and leave it with "/* Trust = Off/".

Emacs will automatically enter this mode if it finds an input containing
the "input" string. To prevent this behaviour, you can use the variable
gp-no-worryp and set it to t, through usual customization.

===========================================================================
Notes
=====

1) You may edit previous expressions, and then type RET to send them to gp.
   However if you want the *PARI* buffer to contain a script of a valid gp
   session, you may prefer to use M-RET to copy the expression to the end
   of the buffer, before editing it.

2) M-\ c is supposed to be a version of the gp meta command \c, although
   it does not send \c to gp.
   M-\ p does not correspond to the gp meta command \p but rather to the
   command default(prompt,...). If this disturbs you it is easy enough to bind
   M-\ p to a command that inserts \p into the *PARI* buffer. The command
   gp-set-prompt can then be bound to any key sequence that you wish. 
   All the other commands on the M-\ prefix do work by sending a gp meta
   command to the *PARI* buffer.

3) pari-mode-hook/gp-mode-hook/gp-script-mode-hook:
   Individual users can customise gp-mode without having to make copies of
   the file pari.el and most of this customization is automatically done
   (see the CUSTOMIZATION section above).
   For more specific purposes there are *three* hooks, namely gp-mode-hook,
   gp-script-mode-hook and an additional hook 'pari-mode-hook common to both
   modes. You should mostly use pari-mode-hook but can use also the two more
   specialised gp-mode-hook (run by the gp command) and
   gp-script-mode-hook (run while starting a gp-script), both
   in addition to and after pari-mode-hook. Essentially the only example where
   gp-mode-hook *has to* be used rather than pari-mode-hook is when
   setting the prompt via gp-set-prompt (see end of this note and next one).
   The format is:

       (setq pari-mode-hook 
         (function (lambda ()
          ... commands to run when starting up gp ...
        )))

   An example is:

       (setq pari-mode-hook 
         (function (lambda ()
           (define-key gp-map "\M-\\p" 'gp-meta-p)
           (define-key gp-map "\M-p" 'gp-set-prompt)
           (setq gp-stack-size 1000000)
           (setq gp-prime-limit 2000)
           (gp-cpl-file my-file)
       )))

  This: 
        Binds a function which sends \p to gp (which would need to be defined
             somewhere else), to M-\ p.
        Binds gp-set-prompt to M-p.
        Defines the default stack size and prime limit as 10000 and 2000.
        Let the completion system use all the commands listed in the
             file my-file.

   In case, customization is not possible through the menu-bar, (see
   section CUSTOMIZATION), here is a generic way to set pari-mode-hook:
      (setq pari-mode-hook
       (function (lambda ()
              ; To ask/remove tutorial help:
              (setq gp-tutorial-requiredp t)
              ; To set/remove fontifying:
              (setq gp-fontifyp t)
              ; To set/remove both menu-bars:
              (setq gp-menu-barp t)
              ; To set parameters of gp:
              (setq gp-stack-size 10000000)
              (setq gp-prime-limit 500000)
              ; To ask gp to not/always ask for arguments:
              (setq gp-prompt-for-args nil)
              ; To ensure a proper default for completion:
              (setq gp-complete-choice 'gp-complete)
              ; To keep the PARI buffer when quitting:
              (setq gp-keep-PARI-buffer-when-quitting t)
              ; To have mistakes displayed on a separate window:
              (setq gp-separate-window-for-mistakes t)
              ; To define GP-browser style (1, 2 or 3):
              (setq gp-browser-style 3)
              ; To set locked mode:
              (setq gp-locked-modep t)
              ; To select the language:
              (setq gp-language 'francais)
              )))

   A change in prompt, which has not gone to the .gprc (see below), *has to*
   use the gp-mode-hook. It reads

   (setq gp-mode-hook
      (function (lambda ()
         ; Select a new prompt:
         ; (gp-set-prompt "...")
       )))
   
   And for instance '...(get-set-prompt "(%R) gp > "))))' will set the
   prompt to "(%R) gp > " as soon as you enter gp.

4) Command line arguments.
   The gp executable file is specified in the variable gp-file-name. This
   is set in the file pari.el, but users can override this setting, either
   in their pari-mode-hook, or by using the C-u prefix to gp. In either case,
   the full path name need not be given if gp is in a directory specified
   in your PATH variable (or the equivalent in csh).
   The variables gp-stack-size and gp-prime-limit should be set to integers
   specifying the arguments to gp. See the above example.

   If these variables are  set to "", then the appropriate flags 
      "-s" or "-p" are *not* sent to gp. 
   If RET is typed in response to any of the prompts produced by C-u M-x gp
      then the default value, ie., the value of gp-file-name, gp-stack-size,
      or gp-prime-limit, is assumed. 
   If a space is sent to the prompt (ie SPC RET) then the appropriate argument
       is not  sent to gp, even if the default is non-empty.

   People who often use different settings for these arguments, may like
   either to add the line

   (setq gp-prompt-for-args t)
   to their gp-mode-hook, or to use the command (outside the gp-mode-hook)
   (custom-set-variables
      '(gp-prompt-for-args t))
   This makes M-x gp act like C-u M-x gp.

5) Prompt.
   Emacs needs to know at all time what your prompt looks like: it's stored
   at all times in gp-prompt-pattern. If you must change your prompt
   (e.g. with default(prompt,...)) without telling emacs,  emacs
   will try to understand what you mean, and else tell you it has not
   succeeded. What you *cannot* use is the command "default(prompt,fn())"
   where "fn" is a gp-function which evaluates to a string. Emacs
   will accept it though, but won't modify the prompt-pattern, so it
   may lead to errors.

   If you intend to change your prompt in your .gprc and not in an
   emacs session, you have to modify the gp-prompt-pattern regular
   expression yourself (AFTER loading pari.el in your .emacs). For instance:

   (setq gp-prompt-pattern
     (concat "^> [\C-j\t ]*\\|" gp-prompt-pattern))

   caters for a 'prompt = "> "' in .gprc. If you use autoload, put this
   command in 'pari-mode-hook and *not* in 'gp-mode-hook (see the note 3
   for the way to proceed). Don't forget to anchor your prompt
   at the beginning of the line (the '^' at the beginning). And don't forget
   to concatenate the old pattern as well. A more complicated one is to deal
   with 'prompt = "(%R) gp > "':

   (setq gp-prompt-pattern
    (concat "^([0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]) gp > [\C-j\t ]*\\|" gp-prompt-pattern))

6) Emacs Version.
   This script has been writen for emacs 21 and tested on emacs 22.

===========================================================================

TroubleShooting:

  -- The present program has been designed for using bash, with a mild
     support for tcsh. If you encounter a trouble in the shell part,
     you can first try to set the shell to bash via e.g.
     (setq shell-file-name "/bin/bash") in your .emacs file.

  -- Parenthesis are *not* handled by this program anymore, simply because
     paren.el does the job.

  -- The byte compilation of emacs 22 and of emacs 21 are different.
     So be sure to use byte-compiled code adapted to emacs version
     you use. In case of trouble, first remove all the .elc files and
     only keep the .el (not compiled) version. This will be slightly
     slower but safer.
