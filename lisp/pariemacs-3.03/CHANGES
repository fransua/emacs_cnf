This package was developped alongside PARI/GP for a long time.
The original pari.el was written by Annette Hoffman.

=================
FROM 2.55 to 2.99
=================
This version and later ones require the emacs version being at least 20.3.
If you are used to versions of pari.el below 2.55, we recommend you read
the README file since a good number of changes have occured in between. Rapidly
speaking, fontification is now handled by font-lock and not by hilit19, and
customization is systematically handle by 'custom.el, so that a good number
of switches have disappeared from the menu-bar. Indentation has appeared
with the neat effect that C-i/TAB is *not* completion anymore. Completion
is got by M-i. Variables are now in "positive form", so that for instance
gp-no-fontify has been replaced by gp-fontifyp and so on. Also, the
distribution consists of 9 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   pariemacs-<version>.txt: this file
=================
FROM 3.00 to 3.02
=================
From version 3.00 onwards, further simplifications have occurred:
completion files have been completely removed, since the dabbrev mode
(dynamical abbreviation mode) of emacs is largely enough (M-/ will
complete word according to words found around, or in nearby buffers).

Also, the distribution consists now of 12 files:
   pari.el                : the main engine
   pari-messages.el       : messages
   pari-fontification.el  : support for font-lock
   pari-help.el           : info and help, browser
   pari-completion.el     : completion
   pari-history.el        : history for shell commands
   sli-tools.el           : indentation, version 0.97 or higher
   pari-conf.el.in        : system dependent variables
   Makefile               : makefile to create pari-conf.el and to install
                            the distribution
   CHANGES                : this file
   README                 : notes on how to install and use pariemacs;
                            essentially what was called pariemacs-<version>.txt.

=================
FROM 3.02 to 3.03
=================
-- Modification of the prompt pattern to take care of break>.
-- Initial message explaining somewhat the levels of loading.
-- Enhanced the messages concerning lisp functions by adding more
   cross-references.
-- Removed call to obsolete font-lock-unset-default in
   gp-make-gp-prompt-pattern.
-- Added a menu-item to get the prompt to display time in format (HH:MM:SS).
-- Face gp-error used in override mode.
-- font-lock-keywords-only set to t in gp-mode.
-- Removed gp-search-forward-string-delimiter in pari-fontification.el.
-- The character " in plots does not trigger string coloring in next
   input.
-- Parisize increased to 10000 in process Simple PARI (for the browser).
-- A menu-bar item has been added to toggle the timer.
-- The word "time = " for the timer gets a special colour.
-- The prompt is in bold face now.
-- Buffers linked with the browser are now invisible because
   their names gp-functions-list-buffer-name, 
               gp-function-description-buffer-name,
               gp-browser-buffer-name, gp-pari-simple-buffer-name
   now starts with a space.
-- Copyright extended to 2009 :)
-- Loading a file when last line is not empty does not lead to a mistake.
-- Prompt can be changed even if the last line contains something.
-- Global variables should be at beginning of line.
-- All words in ?11 except 
   read readvec install 
   are now colored in gp-control-statement.
-- Modified the regexp used in gp-find-global-var for speed
   (it could be so slow on long buffer that it stopped everything).
